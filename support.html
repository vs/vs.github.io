### EULA
Under [SubGit EULA](license.html) you may use SubGit as long as you like for evalution purposes without registration. For production use [registration](pricing.html) is required.

### Users Limited Registration
Registration key you've obtained may set limit on a number of Git users or total number of users. Once mirror is configured, SubGit counts number of active Git and SVN users. Only committers active during last 12 months are taken into account.

Git users are users who push new commits into repository using Git.

SVN users are users who create new commits using SVN client.

In case committers limit set by a key is exceeded for a prolonged period of time, SubGit will temporary disable pushes and Git/SVN sync until mirror repository is registered with a valid registration key.

### Time Limited Registration (for 45 or 90 days)
Time Limited SubGit Registration Key is valid for 45 or 90 days (depending on the key type) since the moment it has been purchased. Upgrades are free during these period of time, i.e. key remains valid for all versions of SubGit published while key is valid.

### Perpetual Registration
Perpetual SubGit Registration Key has no expiration time and remains valid forever. Upgrades are free for twelve (12) months since the moment key has been purchased.
E.g. Registration Key obtained for SubGit obtained on 19th of October 2012 allows free upgrade to all versions of SubGit published until 19th of October 2013.
