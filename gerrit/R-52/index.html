> **WARNING**<br>
[Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) does not trigger standard pre-receive and post-receive hooks when one pushes new commits to Git repository. SubGit heavily relies on those hooks in order to maintain reliable two-way mirror. On this page you can download SubGit plugin for Gerrit that emulates pre-receive hook behavior, however, this plugin has [certain limitations](#limitations).

### 1. Download SubGit Plugin for Gerrit

<p>Build: <strong>&#35;52</strong>, published on: <strong>April 19, 2016:</strong></p>
<center>
	<p><a href="http://old.subgit.com/download/subgit-gerrit-plugin-0.8-EAP_52.jar" class="button_orange" style="margin:-10px 0 -10px 20px !important;">subgit-gerrit-plugin-0.8-EAP_52.jar</a></p>
</center>
<p>MD5 checksum: 53b406a245031415d020b079273bd8af<br>
Compatible Gerrit versions: 2.10.x, 2.11.x and 2.12.x.</p>

### 2. Install SubGit Plugin into Gerrit

<p>Move downloaded file into GERRIT_SITE/plugins/ directory and make sure the plugin becomes enabled at Plugins | Installed:</p>

![List installed plugins]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/gerrit/101_installed_plugins.png)

If you have older version of the plugin, replace it with the newer one.

### 3. Increase receive timeout

Set [receive.timeout](https://git.eclipse.org/r/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#receive) to 0 in [GERRIT_SITE/etc/gerrit.config](https://git.eclipse.org/r/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#_file_code_etc_gerrit_config_code) file and then restart Gerrit server:
	
    $ git config -f GERRIT_SITE/etc/gerrit.config receive.timeout 0
    $ GERRIT_SITE/bin/gerrit.sh restart

By default Gerrit may interrupt `git push` operation on timeout, setting receive.timeout to 0 forces Gerrit to wait until SubGit completes Git-SVN synchronization.

### 4. Create empty Git repository
<p>
Create empty Git repository at Projects | Create New Project:
</p>

![Create empty Git repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/gerrit/102_create_project.png)

### 5. Follow standard instructions

Locate repository directory of created Gerrit project:

    $ ls GERRIT_SITE/git/
    $ ls GERRIT_SITE/git/project.git

and follow [standard instructions]( {{ site.baseurl }}/howto.html) on establishing Git-SVN mirror with SubGit command line tool:

Run the following command to configure Git repository to mirror SVN project:

    $ subgit configure --layout auto SVN_URL GERRIT_SITE/git/project.git

Above command will detect branches layout in the SVN project and generate SubGit configuration file ready for further adjustments.
You may be asked for credentials unless those are already stored in the SVN credentials cache at ~/.subversion/ directory.

Review and adjust branches mapping configuration:

    $ edit GERRIT_SITE/git/project.git/subgit/config

Review and adjust Git/SVN authors mapping: 

    $ edit GERRIT_SITE/git/project.git/subgit/authors.txt

You may use dynamic authors mapping replacing authors.txt with a script. Script sample could be found at GERRIT_SITE/git/project.git/subgit/samples/ directory.

Run the following command to enable mirror and translate SVN revisions to Git commits:

    $ subgit install GERRIT_SITE/git/project.git

As soon as initial translation is completed, Gerrit project is ready to serve users. 
Commits pushed to this project will be translated to Subversion repository and SVN revisions will be translated to Git.

### 6. SubGit Plugin Limitations<a name="limitations"></a>

SubGit plugin for Gerrit emulates pre-receive hook behavior, however, this plugin has certain limitations that lead to the following behavior:

+ With SubGit plugin enabled in Gerrit, one can push any changes to refs/heads/* and refs/tags/* namespaces and SubGit is able to synchronize those commits with Subversion repository reliably, i.e. SubGit mirror never gets into out-of-sync state, Git commits which conflict with any SVN changes get rejected by SubGit.

+ However, if one submits changes throw Gerrit web UI, e.g. by merging reviewed changes into some branch, cherry-picking any commits or creating branches via Gerrit, then SubGit is not able to synchronize those changes reliably: in case some Git commit conflicts with changes committed into Subversion repository, SubGit has to roll back that commit and move it to special refs/subgit/unsynced/* namespace.

Please note that these limitations affect two-way mirrors only; in case of one-way mirrors when changes arrive from Subversion or Git side only, SubGit is able to keep SVN and Git repositories in sync.
