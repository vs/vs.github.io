## 2. GitHub to  SVN mirror

In order to maintain read-write access to GitHub repository and still keep it in sync with Subversion repository, one may setup one-way mirror. In this case any changes submitted to GitHub repository get applied to SVN repository, however, Subversion server has to remain read-only for all SVN users.
