### 1.4 Sync Git repository with GitHub

At this stage you have Git-SVN mirror and then you'd need to establish Git-Git mirror with GitHub repository:
![GitHub SVN mirror]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/github/svn_git_github.png)

    $ cd project.git
    $ git remote add github https://github.com/org/project
    $ git push github --all --follow-tags

In order to send new commits from SubGit-managed repository to GitHub add the following user-post-receive hook and make sure it is an executable file:

    $ echo 'git push --all --follow-tags github' > project.git/hooks/user-post-receive
	$ chmod ug+x project.git/hooks/user-post-receive

Alternatively, you can specify only those branches you're going to synchronize between Subversion and GitHub repositories:

    git push github foo bar

>
Note that the user-post-receive hook gets triggered on every push to SubGit-managed repository and also every time SubGit fetches new revisions from Subversion repository as svn.triggerPostReceive option enables exactly that behavior.
