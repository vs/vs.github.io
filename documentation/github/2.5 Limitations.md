### 2.5 Limitations

One-way GitHub to SVN mirror relies on the fact that no changes arrive to Subversion repository directly, every revision has to be committed to SVN repository via SubGit-managed Git repository. Here's what happens when one commits a new revision to SVN repository directly:

* `subgit fetch` command fetches new revision from Subversion repository and applies this modification to corresponding Git branch;

* on next sync attempt `git fetch github` command overwrites that Git branch, so it matches GitHub repository;

* immediately after fetching changes from GitHub repository, `subgit fetch` command tries to apply these changes to Subversion repository and so it tries to replace SVN branch to its previous revision; in case svn.allowBranchReplacement option is enabled, SubGit deletes that SVN branch and re-creates it from its previous revision, otherwise this synchronization attempt fails with corresponding error message.

>
We strongly recommend to disable write access to Subversion repository and submit any SVN changes through SubGit mirror of GitHub repository.
