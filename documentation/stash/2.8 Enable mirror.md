###  2.8 Enable Mirror

Finally, click **Mirror** button to enable the mirror.
The progress bar will start. Initial import process may take a while depending on the size of SVN repository and your connection to SVN server.

SVN Mirror updates header as soon as import is done. Now you have Git repository synchronized with specified Subversion repository and you can use it as a regular Git repository. You will see changes committed to SVN in your Git repository and vice versa.

After synchronisation is finished, mirroring is turned on. You can switch it off and turn it on again any time you want. Commits pushed to Git while the mirror was switched off would be marked as unsynced and would be presented on the related tab.

You can change configuration, connection settings, authors mapping any time you want.
