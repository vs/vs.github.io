### 3.1. Subversion Projects Location
Subversion repository may contain one or more projects. Project is a location (folder) in Subversion repository which follows Subversion recommended repository layout, i.e. project folder has *trunk*, *branches* and *tags* subfolders:

    /project
        /trunk    # project's "main line"
        /branches # contains project feature and version branches, copied from trunk or other branches
        /tags     # contains project tags (trunk and branches snapshots)

It is not necessary for *trunk*, *branches* and *tags* folders to have these exact names, but the roles of these folders are important. Each project could be mapped to a bare Git repository as shown in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.3 along with the corresponding parts of SubGit configuration file.

**Figure 3.2. SubGit configuration file (single project mapping)**

    [svn]
    # URL that points to a project root
    # (may be the same as Subversion repository root)
    url = http://host/svn/repos

**Figure 3.4. SubGit configuration file (two projects mapping)**

    /var/git/project1.git/subgit/config

        [svn]
        # project location within Subversion repository
        url = http://host/svn/repos/project1
        ...

    /var/git/project2.git/subgit/config

        [svn]
        # project location within Subversion repository
        url = http://host/svn/repos/project2
