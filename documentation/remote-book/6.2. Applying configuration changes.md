###  (1).2. Applying configuration changes

SubGit configuration could be changed after SubGit is installed into repository. Some of the changes become effective immediately and others require *subgit install* or *subgit install --rebuild* command to be executed in order for the changes to be applied.

**Changes that become effective immediately:**

+ Modification of the authors mapping file (subgit/authors.txt)
+ Modification of the password credentials file (subgit/passwd)
+ Modification or creation of the user-\* hook scripts

**Changes that become effective after 'subgit install' is run:**

+ Modification of the core.authorsFile option in the subgit/config file
+ Modification of the svn.fetchInterval option option in the subgit/config file
+ Modification of the [auth] section options in the subgit/config file

*subgit install* command will validate changes made to the subgit/config file and will apply these changes. Background translation process will be restarted if needed.

**Other configuration changes:** In case more changes have to be made, in particular, changes to the branches mapping in subgit/config file, then the easiest way would be to reinstall SubGit following standard configuration stages (see Section 5.1, “Installation Stages”). It is not possible to update branches mapping for a Git repository where SubGit is already installed. To stop background translation process, run *subgit uninstall* command on a Git repository.
