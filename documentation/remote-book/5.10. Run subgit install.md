### 5.10. Run subgit install

Run SubGit install command to make SubGit perform initial translation from Subversion to Git and to enable synchronization.install command uses configuration previously generated by configure command. Sample SubGit install command output is shown below:

    $ subgit install repository.git
    SubGit version 2.0.0 ('Patrick') build #2552

    Translating Subversion revisions to Git commits...

        Subversion revisions translated: 20.
        Total time: 10 seconds.

    INSTALLATION SUCCESSFUL

Initial translation may take a while, during translation time Git repository remains readable, but pushes are disabled for the time of initial import. User could interrupt initial translation with Ctrl-C and resume it later by running subgit install GIT\_REPOS

SubGit install command enables synchronization by installing hooks into Git repository. Existing Git pre-receive and post-receive hooks (if there were any) are preserved and executed normally.

**Figure 5.2. Repository after *install* command is completed**

    GIT_REPOS/
      branches/
      hooks/
        pre-receive               # SubGit hook, do not edit or remove
        user-pre-receive.sample   # user's pre-receive hook template
        post-receive              # SubGit hook, do not edit or remove
        user-post-receive.sample  # user's post-receive hook template
      logs/
      objects/
      refs/
      svn/
      subgit/
      config
      HEAD

As soon as install command reports successful termination, Git users may start to push to the Git repository - new commits will be translated to the new Subversion repository revisions and vice versa - new Subversion revisions will be translated to the new Git commits.
