+ Download SubGit **debian package** file from SubGit [download page](download.html);
+ Run *sudo dpkg -i subgit.deb* to install SubGit;
+ Run *sudo apt-get install -f* to install missing dependencies, if there are any.

Now you may run subgit command from the command line. Test it by running subgit --version command. To upgrade SubGit tool, repeat above steps with the newer debian package file.
