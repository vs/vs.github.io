{% capture content %}
From the very beginning, SubGit was developed as an alternative to Git-Svn, so quite naturally SubGit does resolve many of the Git-Svn limitations. In particular, the following benefits of SubGit might be outlined:

### Migration to Git, not to Git-Svn

**Git-Svn**

*   Learn how to use Git.
*   Learn how to use Git-Svn (read this page).
*   Start using Git-Svn, encounter one of the caveats, read documentation again.
*   Fit your mind to the limited git-svn workflow, avoid non-linear history and merges.

**SubGit**

*   Learn how to use Git.
*   Use Git.

### Install once

**Git-Svn**

*   Each developer in your team:
*   Clones repository with Git-Svn (takes a lot of time depending on repository size).
*   Adjusts Git-Svn configuration, making sure it doesn't conflict with other users' configurations.
*   Suffers of the numerous Git-Svn pitfalls and caveats.

**SubGit**

*   System administrator installs SubGit into your Git or Subversion repository, adjusts configuration, reuses already configured service (e.g. Apache or SSH) for network access.
*   Developers use Git.
*   Nothing is lost in translation

### Nothing is lost in translation

**Git-Svn**

*   User runs Git-Svn 'dcommit' to 'push' changes to Subversion repository.
*   Git commits are translated to Subversion revisions.
*   Another user runs Git-Svn 'rebase' to get these changes.
*   Subversion revisions get translated to Git commits.

Run English to Russian and back to English translation on Google Translate service and you will get a rough idea of what may be lost with Git-Svn.

**SubGit**

*   User pushes Git commits to the Git repository.
*   Git commits are translated to Subversion revisions asynchronously.
*   Another Git user pulls these very commits from the Git repository.
*   Subversion user receives translated revisions on update.
*   SubGit makes sure that translation is only performed when necessary and as asynchronously (in the background) as possible.

### Freedom of tools

**Git-Svn**

*   Only Git-Svn. Only command line. Only linear history.

**SubGit**

*   Use Git and any tool you like, be it IDE-integration or standalone Git UI client.
