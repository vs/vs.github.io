###  (1).3. Run subgit configure

Run SubGit `configure` command to make SubGit detect projects in Subversion repository and generate initial SubGit configuration for them. One have to run configure command on behalf of the same user account that would be used to access Subversion or Git repository. Use sudo command on Linux or OS X or Administrator account on Windows if necessary. Examples below assume Ubuntu Linux and commands are ran on behalf of www-data user that runs Apache Web Server on that system.

When configure command is run on a repository with a single project one will get the following output:

    $ [sudo -u www-data] subgit configure svn_repository
    SubGit version 1.0.2 ('Miai') build #1730

    Detecting paths eligible for translation... done.
    Subversion to Git mapping has been configured:
        <root> : /var/svn/svn_repository/.git

    CONFIGURATION SUCCESSFUL

    To complete SubGit installation do the following:

    1) adjust SubGit configuration file, if necessary:
        /var/svn/svn_repository/conf/subgit.conf
    2) add custom authors mapping to the authors.txt file at:
        /var/svn/svn_repository/conf/authors.txt
    3) run SubGit 'install' command:
        subgit install svn_repository

When SubGit `configure` is run on repository with two projects, mapping will be displayed for the both detected projects:

    $ [sudo -u www-data] subgit configure svn_repository
    SubGit version 1.0.2 ('Miai') build #1730

    Detecting paths eligible for translation... done.
    Subversion to Git mapping has been configured:
        /project1 : /var/svn/svn_repository/git/project1.git
        /project2 : /var/svn/svn_repository/git/project2.git

    CONFIGURATION SUCCESSFUL
    ...

At configuration stage SubGit does not actually create Git repositories, but generates configuration file with the information on detected projects and mappings. Changes to Subversion repository made by the configure command are shown below:

    svn_repository/
      conf/
          authors.txt   # default authors mapping (empty)
          authz
          passwd
          subgit.conf   # projects mapping and general options
          svnserve.conf
      db/
      hooks/
      locks/
      subgit/           # subgit binaries, logs and temporary directory
      format
      README.txt
