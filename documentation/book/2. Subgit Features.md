## Chapter 2. SubGit Features

As a server-side application, SubGit

+ Provides fast asynchronous replication that introduces minimal overhead
+ Puts no limits on Git and Subversion users
+ Fits well into existing server-side infrastructure

SubGit includes powerful translation engine, which would translate

+ merge tracking information and merge history
+ non-linear Git commits history to Subversion
+ subprojects, tags and branches
+ svn:ignore and .gitignore ignore definitions
+ svn:eol-style and .gitattributes special properties
+ symbolic links
+ commit authors and dates
+ files and directories renames

There are a few limitations on translation (see [Chapter 8. Translation Limitations](#)). These limitations only affects translation, and do not prevent Git and Subversion from being used to their full extents.
