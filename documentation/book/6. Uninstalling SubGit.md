## Chapter 6. Uninstalling SubGit

Run `subgit uninstall` command to disable synchronization or to uninstall SubGit completely.
Being run without options `uninstall` command removes SubGit hooks thus disabling translation:

    $ [sudo -u www-data] subgit uninstall svn_repository
    SubGit version 1.0.2 ('Miai') build #1730

    SubGit hooks have been removed from Git repository:
        /var/svn/svn_repository/.git

    SubGit hooks have been removed from Subversion repository:
        /var/svn/svn_repository

    Subversion and Git are no longer kept in sync.

Until Subversion and Git histories diverge, you may run SubGit `subgit install` to enable synchronization back.

Run `subgit uninstall` command with the `--purge` option to remove SubGit completely. This command will remove:

+ SubGit hooks (user hooks will be restored)
+ SubGit binaries and log files
+ SubGit metadata

Git repository will **not** be removed by the `uninstall --purge` command, but it will be no longer be kept in sync with the Subversion repository. To restore synchronization later one will have to run `subgit configure` command followed by `subgit install --rebuild` one just as in case of the fresh install (see [Section 4.1, “Installation Stages”](#8)).
