###  (1).6. Recommended client-side Git configuration

Git users will clone Git repository on the server side to start working with the project locally. There are number of configuration options that is recommended to add to the clone's *.git/config* configuration file. These options are not required, but merely recommended for better user experience.

**Fetch SubGit mapping information:**

    [remote "origin"]
        ...
        fetch = +refs/svn/map:refs/notes/commits

*refs/notes/commmits* reference points to the so called notes that contains Subversion to Git mapping information for each commit. Note that this fetch line should be added as a new line and not appended to any existing *fetch* lines. With these notes *fetched, git log* command will show mapping information alongside with the commit message in the log output:

    $ git log
    commit bee5c8ae9bd8b2077f1acaedc9982ab4bd84d91b

        Ugly bug fixed

    Notes:
        r1 trunk

**Fetch all tags:**

    [remote "origin"]
        ...
        tagopts = '--tags'

--tags option will force Git to fetch all tags, even those unreachable from the current branch. These may be convenient in case user would like to see or check out tag set on the other branch.
