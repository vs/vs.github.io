## Chapter 10. Error Recovery

SubGit is very stable, but as with any application working in complex environment, errors may happen due to various reasons, like unexpected server shutdown, out of memory condition, process being killed, etc. In case of SubGit errors could be localized to the translation failure, either from Subversion to Git or in the opposite directory.

SubGit has built in error handling mechanism and offers error recovery procedures. The way potential translation failures are handled is controlled by the `core.failSafe` configuration option in the `conf/subgit.conf` file:

    [core]
            ..
            failSafe = auto|svn|git

Default `core.failSafe` option value is `auto`.

**Auto mode:**

In the auto mode, failed translation results in commits or pushes to be blocked on the side to which translation has failed. This allows history of Subversion and Git repositories not to diverge and synchronization to be restored later.

**Figure 10.1. Auto mode: Subversion to Git translation fails.**

**Figure 10.2. Auto mode: Git to Subversion translation fails.**
![Auto mode: Git to Subversion translation fails]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/subgitbook/git2svn-fail-auto.png)

Users who will attempt to push or to commit changes via the side that is blocked, will not succeed and will receive an error message (for the case Git side is blocked as in Figure 10.1):

    WARNING:
      descriptive error message
    CURRENT STATE:
      Subversion: READ AND WRITE
      Git       : READ ONLY
    TO RECOVER:
      Run on the server:
         subgit install /var/svn/repos

As it is said, to recover run `subgit install svn_repository` on the server side. It will translate not yet translated commits or revisions and will enable synchronization back.

Depending on the error message and on whether translation failures persist, it makes sense to check if there are something in the environment that causes those issues. Common reasons are:

+ Service accounts misconfiguration (see [Section 4.2, “Setup Service Accounts”](#9))
+ Multiple accounts being used, but SubGit `core.shared` option is set to false (see [Section 4.4. Adjust configuration](#11), Enable shared access:)
+ Insufficient amount of memory available for the translation process

In case fixing the reason of the problem requires changing SubGit configuration, then change configuration first and run `subgit install` to restore synchronization when all necessary configuration options are set.

**Svn or Git mode:**

Sometimes it is desirable to always keep certain (either Subversion or Git) side unblocked, even when translation to that side have failed:

    [core]
        # commits to Subversion are never blocked:
        failSafe = svn

Or:

    [core]
        # pushes to Git are never blocked:
        failSafe = git

Following git or svn translation failure handling policy may naturally result in Subversion and Git histories to diverge (commit "c2" and revision "r2" represent diverged history on both figures):

**Figure 10.3. History diverges in the svn mode**
![History diverges in the svn mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/subgitbook/git2svn-fail-svn.png)

**Figure 10.4. History diverges in the git mode**
![History diverges in the git mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/subgitbook/svn2git-fail-git.png)

Compare above with how SubGit handles translation failures in the auto mode (Figure 10.1 and Figure 10.2). To recover from the case when history in Git and Subversion repositories had diverged, multi-step recovery procedure have to be performed. Commands and figures below assume single project Subversion repository at `/var/svn/repos` synchronized with a single Git repository at `/var/svn/repos/.git` with history diversion between Git master branch and Subversion trunk.

**Figure 10.5. Diverged Subversion and Git histories on trunk and master branch**

**1) Create a backup Git repository.**

    # create clone of the original Git repository
    $ git clone /var/svn/repos repos.backup

    # track all remote branches on which there are untranslated commits
    $ cd repos.backup
    $ git checkout master
    ...
    $ git checkout foo

**2) Reset Git references to the pre-diversion state.**

Branch and tag references to the last translated commits are stored in the `refs/svn/root` namespace of the original repository. Exact reference name in `refs/svn/root` depends on the branches and tags mapping configured for this Git repository (see [Section 3.2, “Branches and Tags mapping”](#5)). Default correspondence is:

    refs/svn/root/trunk      => refs/heads/master
    refs/svn/root/branches/* => refs/heads/*
    refs/svn/root/shelves/*  => refs/shelves/*
    refs/svn/root/tags/*     => refs/tags/*

Use git update-ref command to reset existing references:

    # Reset master reference to point to the last translated commit.
    $ cd /var/svn/repos
    $ git update-ref refs/heads/master refs/svn/root/trunk

    # In case diverged history includes changes on branches, special shelf branches
    # and tags, then you may need to run commands like:

    $ git update-ref refs/heads/branch refs/svn/root/branches/branch
    $ git update-ref refs/shelves/bar refs/svn/root/shelves/bar
    $ git update-ref refs/tags/1.0 refs/svn/root/tags/1.0

    # In case diverged history includes creation of a new branch or tag, then
    # it has to be deleted:

    $ git branch -D missing
    $ git tag -D missingTag

**Figure 10.6. Master branch reset to the pre-diversion state**
![Master branch reset to the pre-diversion state]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/subgitbook/recovery-reset.png)

**3) Enable SubGit synchronization.**

    # reset error state and enable synchronization back
    $ subgit install /var/svn/repos
    ...
    Subversion to Git mapping has been found:
        <root> : /var/svn/repos/.git

    Information on previously encountered errors is cleared.
    ...
    INSTALLATION SUCCESSFULL

SubGit `install` command will translate all not yet translated Subversion revisions to Git commits, thus eliminating history diversion on Subversion side. Next step will merge in diverted Git history back into original repository thus translating it to Subversion.

**4) Restore backed up commits.**

    # go to back up repository cloned at the first stage
    $ cd repos.backup
    # fetch pre-diversion state references
    $ git fetch --all
    $ git fetch --tags

    # for each branch that has diverged commits do rebase or merge:
    $ git checkout master

    $ git rebase origin/master
    OR
    $ git merge origin/master

    # push new state with commits restored back to the original repository:
    $ git push --all
