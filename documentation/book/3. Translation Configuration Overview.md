## Chapter 3. Translation Configuration Overview

To synchronize Subversion and Git repositories, SubGit maps entities of one system to those of another. For every Subversion repository the following mappings are established and used by SubGit:

+ Projects in Subversion repository are mapped to the Git repositories
+ Each project branches and tags are mapped to Git branch and tag references
+ Subversion users are mapped to Git committers

Above mappings are static and configured for Subversion repository once before translation and synchronization is started. All mappings are stored in `subgit.conf` configuration file. Following sections describe these mappings in more details.

> **Note:**<br>
> Subversion is a very powerful system and sets mostly no limits on the repository layout. Hence, it may not be always possible to define necessary mappings for any project stored in Subversion repository found out there in the wild. Such unmappable projects would not be handled by SubGit. However, for most of the Subversion repositories in production use, mappings could be defined and, in most cases, they are detected automatically by SubGit.
