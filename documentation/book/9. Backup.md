## Chapter 9. Backup

SubGit as of version 1.0 does not provide integrated backup solution. Standard Subversion and Git tools should be used to back up repositories.

**Backup Subversion repository only:**

Back up Subversion repository with `svnadmin` tool. Plus back up conf/subgit.conf and authors mapping (conf/author.txt) files.

    $ svnadmin dump /var/svn/repos > repos.dump
    $ cp /var/svn/repos/conf/subgit.conf subgit.conf.backup
    $ cp /var/svn/repos/conf/authors.txt authors.txt.backup

Restore repository from dump when necessary and reinstall SubGit (see) into restored repository, with the old configuration and authors mapping.

    $ svnadmin load /var/svn/repos < repos.dump
    $ subgit configure /var/svn/repos
    $ cp subgit.conf.backup /var/svn/repos/conf/subgit.conf
    $ cp authors.txt.backup /var/svn/repos/conf/authors.txt
    $ subgit install /var/svn/repos

Git users will have to clone Git repositories again, as newly created Git repositories will contain commit with different hash IDs than before. Make sure to run all commands on behalf of the user who runs Git or Subversion service (see [Section 4.2, “Setup Service Accounts”](#9)).

**Backup all:**

Sometimes it might be more convenient to backup Subversion repository along with Git repositories and SubGit metada. First, disable Git pushes and then disable SubGit synchronization (single Git repository is assumed):

    # make user-pre-receive hook reject all pushes:
    $ cp /var/svn/repos/.git/hooks/user-pre-receive /var/svn/repos/.git/hooks/user-pre-receive.backup
    $ echo '#!/bin/sh\nexit 1' > /var/svn/repos/.git/hooks/user-pre-receive

    # disable synchronization
    $ subgit uninstall /var/svn/repos

Wait for any ongoing translation to finish. Run jps command and check that no Java process named `SubGitDaemon` is running. This process should exit as soon as translation is over and will not start again, because synchronization is disabled now. Then, back up everything, reinstall SubGit and enable synchronization and Git pushes back:

    # back up all data
    $ svnadmin hotcopy /var/svn/repos repos.backup

    # enable synchronization
    $ subgit install /var/svn/repos

    # make user-pre-receive hook no longer reject pushes
    $ rm /var/svn/repos/.git/hooks/user-pre-receive
    $ cp /var/svn/repos/.git/hooks/user-pre-receive.backup /var/svn/repos/.git/hooks/user-pre-receive

Similarly restore Subversion repository along with the Git one and SubGit metadata:

    # restore up all data
    $ svnadmin hotcopy repos.backup /var/svn/repos

    # enable synchronization
    $ subgit install /var/svn/repos

    # make user-pre-receive hook no longer reject pushes
    $ rm /var/svn/repos/.git/hooks/user-pre-receive
    $ cp /var/svn/repos/.git/hooks/user-pre-receive.backup /var/svn/repos/.git/hooks/user-pre-receive

Make sure to run all commands on behalf of the user who runs Git or Subversion service (see [Section 4.2, “Setup Service Accounts”](#9)).
