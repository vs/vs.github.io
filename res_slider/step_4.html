<h1>Step three: adding the Mirror as a remote</h1>
<p>The final step is to add the Git mirror as a remote to existing git repository linked with GOGS. To do so just run a command with CMD/BASH in the git repository:
    <br><br>
    <b>git remote add ORIGIN_NAME REPOS.GIT</b>
    <br><br>
    Where: <ul>
    <li>ORIGIN_NAME is the name of remote</li>
    <li>REPOS.GIT is path to the Git mirror</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    With the help of the Git/SVN mirror the remote now will work as an interface between git and SVN repository letting you pull and push branches back and fourth between them.</p>
