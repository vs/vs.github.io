### About Us

TMate Software was founded in a year 2004 and since that time gathered huge experience in the area of version control software. Its most renowned product is SVNKit â€” Java version of Subversion. In 2012 we released SubGit: SVN to Git migration tool. The unique feature of SubGit is bi-directional mirroring of Subversion and Git repositories. That allows to migrate teams of any size easily, from single author projects to companies of 20,000 employees. Now SubGit became a tool of choice for such companies as Boeing, Comcast, NASA, AT&T and many others.

Today we want to strengthen SubGit marketing by adding more people to the team and allow for better focus in both product development and marketing outreach.
